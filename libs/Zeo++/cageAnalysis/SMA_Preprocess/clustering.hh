/* ClusterizeComplex
 * 	Given a complex, it applies density-based clustering to merge those points that are close enough to each other to be considered the same.
 * 	Edges are recomputed considering if they connected points within clusters (i.e., there will be an edge between two clusters if there was
 * 	an edge between any point of the first cluster and any point of the second).
 *
 * Inputs:
 * 	TargetComplex - Complex to be clusterized (typically, the Voronoi graph of the molecule).
 *
 * Outputs:
 * 	Clusterized complex.
