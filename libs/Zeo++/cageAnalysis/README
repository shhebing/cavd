—— HOW TO RUN SMA IN UNIX BASED SYSTEMS ——

PREREQUISITES

Requisites: 
To work properly, the software requires an installation of CGAL into the computer. CGAL installation can be done manually or through repositories.

CGAL Download:

http://www.cgal.org/download/linux.html

CGAL Installation:

http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html

Linking CGAL:

Use the following command to make CGAL accessible from any program:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=“/usr/local/lib”

COMPILATION

Compilation of the software can be done with the included makefiles.

First, enter the voro++ folder, and execute:

make clean & make

Then, go to the main folder, and execute:

make

If CGAL has been properly linked, compilation should run successfully.

EXECUTION

The program currently accepts three file formats and several execution modes.

Input file formats:

.mol - Performs the analysis (partial or complete) over the given molecule.
.frameid - Non-standard format to describe molecular sets. Extracts the first molecule of the list and prints it in .mol format.
.sdf - Performs analysis over all molecules included in file.

Execution:

To run the program, type:

./single_mol_analysis [options] Filename

Filename - File containing the molecule/s 3d description. 

Basic run will compute three first descriptors for all the molecules provided. 

Options:

-w	Compute windows with help of alpha shape. Generates all the extra descriptors (see below).
-p	Print several output files with details about: pruning process, voronoi network, internal cells, and windows (if this option was chosen).
-e	Exploratory mode: faster test to decide whether a molecule could be a cage. If passed, descriptors will be computed (otherwise, output will be 0 for all of them).
-np	Avoid pruning of hanging atoms before computing.
-olt	Overlap test: check if any pair of molecules from the ones provided as input overlap each other. SDF only.
-iep	Internal/external points: requires extra argument (name of file with points in 3d coordinates, global) just after the flag. Checks if the points given are inside provided molecule.



OUTPUT

Text output:

Output is presented regarding the mode selected by the user. Each parameter is presented after its corresponding character code. All information is presented in only one line.

- Maximum internal sphere (MIS)
- Total accessible volume (TIV)
- Total convex hull volume (CHV)
- Number of windows - chemical (NW)*
- Number of entry paths (NEP)*
- Total computed surface (TCP)*
- Maximum accessible size (IAS)*

* - Shown only if -w option is chosen.

Visualization:

If -p flag is chosen, files for visualisation will be created. Output format is VTK and can be visualised with VisIt [https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/downloads]. Output files will be stored in a folder with the same name as the molecule (if SDF format) or in a folder named Molecule otherwise. This new folder will be created at Molecules_Output folder (provided with the code).
