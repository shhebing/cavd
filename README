CAVD: A tool for high-throughput geometric analysis of ionic transport

CAVD (Crystal structure Analysis by Voronoi Decomposition) is an efficien tool for performing high-throughput geometric analysis of crystal structure and ionic transport inside structure. Using CAVD, the void space inside crystal space can be characterized as the interstitial network consisting of the interstitial model and channel segment with defined bottleneck by radical Voronoi decomposition. The symmetry analysis of interstices performed by Spglib, the radii of ionic calculated by combining O'kefee's rigorous definition of coordinate number and Shannon effective ionic radii table. Underlying radical Voronoi decomposition carried out by Voro++, an open source library for carrying out three-dimensional computations of the Voronoi tessellation.
