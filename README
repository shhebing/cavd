=====================================================================

CAVD (Crystal structure Analysis by Voronoi Decomposition) is an 
high-throughput tool that towards better characterization of void 
space for ionic transport analysis. 

Using CAVD, the void space inside ionic crystal can be characterized 
as the 3D network consisting of interstices, channels between interstices, 
and bottlenecks of the channels, which are identified and quantified 
from the position and geometry of Voronoi polyhedra vertices, edges, and faces, 
respectively. The geometric and topological parameters of the network 
are then translated into ion transport descriptors. These descriptors 
form the foundation of machine-learning algorithms to predict and optimize 
materials properties.

In addition, some libraries are called in our implementation: the symmetry 
analysis of interstices performed by Spglib; the periodic radical Voronoi 
decomposition provided by Voro++; the calculation algorithms of channel 
and connected threshold referenced from Zeo++. All calculations discussed 
are implemented in the python package CAVD, and the code can be accessed 
on our repository based on the FAIR principles for the benefit of the 
broad research community.


*** Install from .whl package ***
=====================================================================

1) Download the corresponding .whl package according to the Python version
 (e.g. cavd-0.1.26-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl).

2) Install cavd library:
   pip install cavd-0.1.26-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

3) Test that the installation worked using the "test_bmdcom.py" in examples package. 


*** Install from source code in Linux ***
=====================================================================

1) Download and unpack the provided cavd package (the following commands
 will create cavd-0.2.0 directory containing the cavd code;

  gunzip cavd-0.2.0.tar.gz
  tar xvf cavd-0.2.0.tar

2) Compile Voro++ library
  
  cd cavd-0.2.0/libs/Voro++/src
  make
  
3) Compile the modified Zeo++ source code:

  cd ../../Zeo++
  make dylib
  
4) Install cavd library:

  cd ../../
  python setup_linux.py develop
  
5) Test that the installation worked using the "test_bmdcom.py" in examples package.
